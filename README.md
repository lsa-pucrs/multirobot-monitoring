# Multirobot supervision system using Nagios and ROS

 This repository constains the software to integrate [Nagios monitoring system](https://www.nagios.org/) into [ROS robotic middleware](http://www.ros.org/) to program multi-robot systems.
 
 A demo of the system was published in the following [paper]() and also in [Felipe's Master Thesis](http://repositorio.pucrs.br/dspace/handle/10923/7732).
